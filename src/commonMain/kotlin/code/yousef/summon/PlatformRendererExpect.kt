// This file likely contained expect/actual declarations for the old PlatformRenderer/MigratedPlatformRenderer.
// Since PlatformRenderer is now a concrete interface in commonMain, these are no longer needed
// and were causing compilation errors (unresolved references, overrides nothing).

// Removed conflicting actual interface/functions related to the old renderer.

// Keep any other unrelated expect/actual declarations if present.
// Example:
// expect fun getSystemTimeMillis(): Long
