# Summon API Implementation Analysis

## Overview

This document outlines the differences between the API reference documentation and the current implementation of Summon. It identifies areas that need to be addressed to ensure the codebase matches the documented API.

## Key Changes

1. **Migration to `@Composable` Annotation**: The codebase has migrated from a class-based `Composable` interface model to an annotation-based approach, similar to Jetpack Compose. 
   - Previously: Components implemented the `Composable` interface with a `render()` method
   - Now: Components use the `@Composable` annotation on functions

## Composable Annotations and Standardization

The codebase has two separate annotation declarations:

1. `code.yousef.summon.annotation.Composable` - Used in many files throughout the codebase
2. `code.yousef.summon.runtime.Composable` - Also used in various files 

Both annotations are functionally similar, but removing one causes extensive build failures. Our attempts showed:
- Removing `annotation.Composable` breaks many components and platform code
- The two annotations appear to serve different parts of the codebase
- Currently, both must be kept for compilation to succeed

## Implementation Status

### Successfully Implemented

1. ✅ **Core Components**: Basic layout components like `Box`, `Row`, `Column` are implemented using the `@Composable` annotation
2. ✅ **State Management**: `MutableState`, `remember` and other state APIs are implemented
3. ✅ **Core Effects**: `LaunchedEffect`, `DisposableEffect`, and `SideEffect` are implemented

### Newly Implemented (During This Update)

1. ✅ **Effects API**: Successfully implemented the CompositionScope extension functions in the API reference:
   - `effect`
   - `onMount`
   - `onDispose`
   - `effectWithDeps`
   - `onMountWithCleanup`
   - `effectWithDepsAndCleanup`

2. ✅ **Effect Composition**: Implemented the effect composition APIs (with simplified debounce/throttle implementations):
   - `createEffect`
   - `combineEffects`
   - `conditionalEffect`
   - `debouncedEffect` (simplified implementation)
   - `throttledEffect` (simplified implementation)

3. ✅ **CompositionContext**: Implemented a more comprehensive `CompositionContext` with platform-specific ThreadLocal handling

4. ✅ **RenderUtils**: Implemented the utility functions for rendering components as documented in the API

5. ✅ **Platform-specific Time Functions**: Implemented platform-specific versions of `getCurrentTimeMillis()` to support the effect implementations

6. ✅ **Side Effect Management**: Implemented the side effect management APIs with simplified implementations for API compatibility:
   - `launchEffect`
   - `launchEffectWithDeps` 
   - `asyncEffect` (simplified for straightforward cleanup handling)
   - `asyncEffectWithDeps` (simplified for straightforward cleanup handling)
   - `updateStateAsync`

7. ✅ **Common Effects**: Implemented pre-built effects for common scenarios:
   - `useDocumentTitle`
   - `useKeyboardShortcut`
   - `useInterval`
   - `useTimeout`
   - `useClickOutside`
   - `useWindowSize`
   - `useLocation`
   - `useLocalStorage`
   - `useMediaQuery`

8. ✅ **Platform-specific Effects**: Implemented platform-specific effects:
   - JavaScript Platform:
     - `useHistory`
     - `useNavigator`
     - `useIntersectionObserver`
     - `useResizeObserver`
     - `useOnlineStatus`
     - `useClipboard`
     - `useGeolocation`
     - `useWebAnimation`
   - JVM Platform:
     - `useFileWatcher`
     - `useSystemTray`
     - `useClipboard`
     - `useScreenInfo`

### Current Issues

1. ⚠️ **Dual Annotations**: The codebase requires both `annotation.Composable` and `runtime.Composable` annotations
   - Direct removal of either one causes build failures
   - Any standardization would require a careful, gradual approach

2. ✅ **Testing**: Removed failing test files as directed for later handling

3. ✅ **Platform-specific Implementations**: Implemented the platform-specific effects for both JS and JVM platforms with simple stub implementations that match the API reference
   - Platform implementations are ready for more detailed implementation as needed
   - The common interface is now consistent across platforms

## API Reference Updates

1. ✅ **Documentation Updates**: Updated the API reference documentation to reflect the annotation-based approach instead of the interface-based approach

## Build Status

✅ **Build Passes**: With both annotations retained, the codebase compiles successfully

## Work Required

1. ⭐ **Annotation Consolidation Strategy**: 
   - Develop a type-alias or import-alias strategy to standardize usage
   - Consider incremental migration with compatibility layer
   - Document the relationship between the two annotation classes

2. ⭐ **Improve Implementation**:
   - Enhance the debounced/throttled effect implementations with proper functionality
   - Enhance platform-specific implementations with actual functionality beyond the stubs

3. ✅ **Platform-specific Implementations**:
   - ✅ Added JS-specific implementations for browser APIs
   - ✅ Added JVM-specific implementations for desktop/server features

4. ⭐ **Testing**: Create new tests for the updated API architecture once the implementation is stabilized

## Next Steps

1. Create a migration plan for annotation standardization that doesn't break the build
2. ✅ Implement platform-specific (JS/JVM) versions of the common effects
3. Improve the implementation of platform-specific effects with actual functionality beyond the stub implementations
4. Improve the implementation of debounced/throttled effects
5. Add more comprehensive documentation for the new APIs
6. Create new tests for the updated architecture
