# Summon API Implementation Analysis

## Overview

This document outlines the differences between the API reference documentation and the current implementation of Summon. It identifies areas that need to be addressed to ensure the codebase matches the documented API.

## Key Changes

1. **Migration to `@Composable` Annotation**: The codebase has migrated from a class-based `Composable` interface model to an annotation-based approach, similar to Jetpack Compose. 
   - Previously: Components implemented the `Composable` interface with a `render()` method
   - Now: Components use the `@Composable` annotation on functions

## Composable Annotation Consolidation

✅ **Annotation Consolidation**: We've successfully consolidated the duplicate annotations:

1. `code.yousef.summon.annotation.Composable` - The single canonical annotation
2. `code.yousef.summon.runtime.Composable` - Now a typealias pointing to the annotation package version

The consolidation was achieved by:
- Removing the duplicate annotation class in the runtime package
- Creating a typealias in the runtime package that points to the annotation package
- Updating the StandardComposable alias in the annotation package
- Creating documentation for a consistent usage pattern

## Implementation Status

### Successfully Implemented

1. ✅ **Core Components**: Basic layout components like `Box`, `Row`, `Column` are implemented using the `@Composable` annotation
2. ✅ **State Management**: `MutableState`, `remember` and other state APIs are implemented
3. ✅ **Core Effects**: `LaunchedEffect`, `DisposableEffect`, and `SideEffect` are implemented

### Newly Implemented (During This Update)

1. ✅ **Effects API**: Successfully implemented the CompositionScope extension functions in the API reference:
