# Summon v0.9.0 - Application Architecture

**Focus**: Robust patterns for data, forms, and state.
**Goal**: Standardize how applications handle data flow and side effects.

## 28. Query/Mutation Library
**Requirement**: A data fetching library with caching and synchronization (similar to TanStack Query).
**Technical Specs**:
- **Caching**: Cache responses by query key.
- **Deduplication**: Combine multiple simultaneous requests for the same key.
- **Revalidation**: Auto-refetch on window focus, network reconnect, or interval.
- **State**: Expose `isLoading`, `isError`, `data` states.
- **Mutations**: Handle side effects (POST/PUT/DELETE) and invalidate related queries.

## 29. Form State Manager
**Requirement**: Simplify form validation and state handling.
**Technical Specs**:
- **State Tracking**: Track values, touched state, and dirty state for fields.
- **Validation**: Support synchronous and asynchronous validation rules.
- **Submission**: Handle form submission, including loading state and error handling.
- **Composability**: Easy integration with UI components via state hoisting.

## 30. Middleware
**Requirement**: Intercept and modify requests/responses in the SSR pipeline.
**Technical Specs**:
- **Interception**: Hook into the request lifecycle before rendering.
- **Routing Control**: Redirect requests based on logic (e.g., auth checks).
- **Headers**: Modify response headers (cookies, caching).
- **Context**: Inject data into the request context for the application to use.

## 31. Suspense & Error Boundaries
**Requirement**: Declarative handling of async loading states and errors.
**Technical Specs**:
- **Suspense**: A container that shows a fallback UI while its content is "suspending" (waiting for async data).
- **Error Boundary**: A container that catches exceptions from its children and displays a fallback UI instead of crashing the app.
- **Recovery**: Mechanism to reset the error boundary and retry rendering.
