# Summon v1.0.0 - Production Ready

**Focus**: Stability, accessibility, and optimization.
**Goal**: Ensure the framework is ready for mission-critical, high-scale production use.

## 34. A11y Primitives
**Requirement**: High-level components to solve common accessibility challenges.
**Technical Specs**:
- **FocusTrap**: Constrain focus within a container (essential for modals).
- **VisuallyHidden**: Hide content visually but keep it available to screen readers.
- **SkipLink**: Mechanism for keyboard users to skip navigation and jump to main content.
- **Announcer**: API to trigger screen reader announcements (polite/assertive) for dynamic content updates.

## 35. Image Optimization Service
**Requirement**: Automatic image optimization for performance.
**Technical Specs**:
- **Component**: `AsyncImage` component that requests optimized assets.
- **Service**: Backend integration to resize, compress, and convert images to modern formats (WebP/AVIF) on the fly.
- **Responsive**: Generate `srcset` for different screen densities and sizes.
- **Lazy Loading**: Native lazy loading support.

## 36. Asset Embedding
**Requirement**: Embed static assets directly in compiled output.
**Technical Specs**:
- **Images**: Embed images and icons as byte arrays in the compiled artifact.
- **Fonts**: Support embedded font resources.
- **Compression**: Apply compression to embedded assets.
- **Access API**: Provide type-safe API to access embedded resources at runtime.

## 37. Server Actions / RPC
**Requirement**: Type-safe communication between client and server without manual API endpoints.
**Technical Specs**:
- **Definition**: Define functions in `commonMain` that execute on the server.
- **Transport**: Automatically serialize arguments and return values.
- **Security**: Context propagation (auth) and input validation.
- **Client Usage**: Call the function directly from client code as a suspend function.

## 38. Payment Primitives
**Requirement**: UI components for payment integration.
**Technical Specs**:
- **PaymentButton**: Standardized payment button component with customizable appearance.
- **PaymentSheet**: Modal sheet for payment method selection and checkout flow.
- **Provider Interface**: Pluggable interface for different payment providers.
- **Accessibility**: Full accessibility support for payment flows.

## 39. Final Polish
**Requirement**: Refine existing APIs for consistency and ease of use.
**Technical Specs**:
- **ViewModel**: Enhance lifecycle integration (`viewModelScope`, `onCleared`, `savedStateHandle`).
- **Animation**: Complete the Compose-compatible animation DSL (`animate*AsState`, `AnimatedVisibility`, `updateTransition`).
- **Resources**: robust `stringResource`, `painterResource` with multi-module support.
- **Intrinsic Measurements**: Support `Modifier.width(IntrinsicSize.Min)` for complex layouts.
