# Summon

**Summon** is a powerful, type-safe frontend framework for Kotlin Multiplatform that brings the elegance of Jetpack Compose to both browser and JVM environments. Build beautiful, responsive applications with a declarative syntax that feels natural to Kotlin developers.

> ðŸŽ¨ **Type-safe styling** with an intuitive modifier API inspired by Compose.
> 
> ðŸ§© **Component-based architecture** for maximum reusability and maintainability.
> 
> ðŸ”„ **Reactive state management** that automatically updates your UI when data changes.

Summon combines the best ideas from modern frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Next.js with the declarative UI patterns of Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI, while leveraging Kotlin's powerful type system to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.

## Inspiration

Summon is proudly inspired by [Kobweb](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb), a modern framework for full stack web apps in Kotlin built upon Compose HTML. Kobweb's elegant API design and approach to creating web applications using Kotlin has been instrumental in shaping Summon's philosophy. We highly recommend checking out Kobweb if you're looking for a mature, feature-rich solution for Kotlin web development.

## Publishing and CI/CD

Summon now includes automated publishing and continuous integration. The project supports publishing to both Maven Central and GitHub Packages with comprehensive testing.

### Automated Publishing

Publishing happens automatically through GitHub Actions:

- **On push to `main`**: 
  - Builds are automatically published to GitHub Packages
  - Bundle is created and uploaded to Maven Central Portal
  - Maven Central publication happens automatically after validation
  - Version is automatically changed to `X.X.X-SNAPSHOT` for snapshots
  - No manual action required - just push to main!
  
- **On GitHub release**:
  - Release builds are published to both GitHub Packages and Maven Central
  - Uses the version tag from the release
  - Automatic publication to Maven Central (no manual approval needed)
  
- **Pull request testing**: All tests run automatically on pull requests

### Setting Up Publishing

Publishing configuration includes:

- Maven Central setup (Sonatype OSSRH)
- GPG key generation and configuration
- GitHub Secrets configuration
- Local development setup

**Important:** Publishing to Maven Central requires authentication:

**For CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
- Set up the following as GitHub repository secrets (Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions):
  - `CENTRAL_USERNAME` - Your Sonatype OSSRH username
  - `CENTRAL_PASSWORD` - Your Sonatype OSSRH password
  - `SIGNING_KEY_ID` - Your GPG key ID for signing artifacts
  - `SIGNING_PASSWORD` - Your GPG key passphrase
  - `SIGNING_SECRET_KEY` - Your GPG private key (base64 encoded)
- Publishing will run automatically on releases

**For Local Publishing to Maven Central Portal:**
- Export the required environment variables:
  ```bash
  export CENTRAL_USERNAME="your-central-portal-username"
  export CENTRAL_PASSWORD="your-central-portal-token"
  ```
- Run the publishing script:
  ```bash
  ./publish-to-central-portal.sh  # Linux/macOS
  # or
  publish-to-central-portal.bat   # Windows (requires manual upload step)
  ```
- This creates a bundle and uploads it to the Central Portal
- The bundle is automatically published to Maven Central after validation
- Monitor status at https://central.sonatype.com

**Publishing to GitHub Packages (currently active):**
- Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set with `write:packages` permission
- Run `./gradlew publishAllPublicationsToGitHubPackagesRepository`

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you see errors about `publishJsPublicationToCentralRepository` or wrong URLs:
  - Run `./clean-gradle-cache.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `clean-gradle-cache.bat` (Windows)
  - This completely clears Gradle's cache to remove any stale configuration
- The repository has been renamed from "central" to "OSSRH" to avoid conflicts
- Maven Central publishing requires proper OSSRH credentials and namespace verification
- If the error persists showing `https://central.sonatype.com/api/v1/publisher/deployments/`:
  - This is the new Central Portal API URL (for accounts created in 2024+)
  - The new Central Portal requires different configuration than traditional OSSRH
  - **Current workaround**: Use GitHub Packages for publishing (working and configured)
  - To check your account type: Log in to https://central.sonatype.com - if it works, you have a Central Portal account

### Quick Testing

Run the included test scripts to verify everything works locally:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
run-tests.bat
```

These scripts will:
- âœ… Run all tests (JVM, JS with Chrome headless, and common)
- ðŸ”¨ Generate test reports in `build/reports/tests/`
- ðŸ“‹ Show test results summary

**Note:** JS tests may fail due to a known issue with Kotlin 2.2.0-Beta1 and kotlinx-serialization. This is a temporary issue that doesn't affect the main code compilation.

For a full build including packaging:
```bash
./gradlew build -x jsTest -x jsBrowserTest
```

## Local Development Setup

For development or if you want to use a locally built version:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codeyousef/summon.git
cd summon
```

### 2. Build and Install to Local Maven Repository

```bash
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

### 3. Add the Local Repository to Your Project

In your project's `settings.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        mavenCentral()
        // other repositories
    }
}
```

### 4. Include the Dependency

In your project's `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation("io.github.codeyousef:summon:0.2.5.1")
            }
        }

        val jvmMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation("io.github.codeyousef:summon-jvm:0.2.5.1")
            }
        }

        val jsMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation("io.github.codeyousef:summon-js:0.2.5.1")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Using Published Versions

Summon is published to GitHub Packages, with Maven Central support coming soon.

### From GitHub Packages (Recommended)
```kotlin
repositories {
    maven {
        url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/codeyousef/summon")
        credentials {
            username = project.findProperty("gpr.user") as String? ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_ACTOR")
            password = project.findProperty("gpr.key") as String? ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
        }
    }
}
```
