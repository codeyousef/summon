# Summon

**Summon** is a powerful, type-safe frontend framework for Kotlin Multiplatform that brings the elegance of Jetpack Compose to both browser and JVM environments. Build beautiful, responsive applications with a declarative syntax that feels natural to Kotlin developers.

> ðŸŽ¨ **Type-safe styling** with an intuitive modifier API inspired by Compose.
> 
> ðŸ§© **Component-based architecture** for maximum reusability and maintainability.
> 
> ðŸ”„ **Reactive state management** that automatically updates your UI when data changes.

Summon combines the best ideas from modern frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Next.js with the declarative UI patterns of Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI, while leveraging Kotlin's powerful type system to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.

## Inspiration

Summon is proudly inspired by [Kobweb](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb), a modern framework for full stack web apps in Kotlin built upon Compose HTML. Kobweb's elegant API design and approach to creating web applications using Kotlin has been instrumental in shaping Summon's philosophy. We highly recommend checking out Kobweb if you're looking for a mature, feature-rich solution for Kotlin web development.

## Publishing and CI/CD

Summon now includes automated publishing and continuous integration. The project supports publishing to both Maven Central and GitHub Packages with comprehensive testing.

### Automated Publishing

Publishing happens automatically through GitHub Actions:

- **On push to `main`**: 
  - Builds are automatically published to GitHub Packages
  - Bundle is created and uploaded to Maven Central Portal
  - Maven Central publication happens automatically after validation
  - Version is automatically changed to `X.X.X-SNAPSHOT` for snapshots
  - No manual action required - just push to main!
  
- **On GitHub release**:
  - Release builds are published to both GitHub Packages and Maven Central
  - Uses the version tag from the release
  - Automatic publication to Maven Central (no manual approval needed)
  
- **Pull request testing**: All tests run automatically on pull requests

### Setting Up Publishing

Publishing configuration includes:

- Maven Central setup (Sonatype OSSRH)
- GPG key generation and configuration
- GitHub Secrets configuration
- Local development setup

**Important:** Publishing to Maven Central requires authentication:

**For CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
- Set up the following as GitHub repository secrets (Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions):
  - `CENTRAL_USERNAME` - Your Sonatype OSSRH username
  - `CENTRAL_PASSWORD` - Your Sonatype OSSRH password
  - `SIGNING_KEY_ID` - Your GPG key ID for signing artifacts
  - `SIGNING_PASSWORD` - Your GPG key passphrase
  - `SIGNING_SECRET_KEY` - Your GPG private key (base64 encoded)
- Publishing will run automatically on releases

**For Local Publishing to Maven Central Portal:**
- Export the required environment variables:
  ```bash
  export CENTRAL_USERNAME="your-central-portal-username"
  export CENTRAL_PASSWORD="your-central-portal-token"
  ```
- Run the publishing script:
  ```bash
  ./publish-to-central-portal.sh  # Linux/macOS
  # or
  publish-to-central-portal.bat   # Windows (requires manual upload step)
  ```
- This creates a bundle and uploads it to the Central Portal
- The bundle is automatically published to Maven Central after validation
- Monitor status at https://central.sonatype.com

**Publishing to GitHub Packages (currently active):**
- Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set with `write:packages` permission
- Run `./gradlew publishAllPublicationsToGitHubPackagesRepository`

**Troubleshooting Publishing Issues:**

**If you see errors about `publishJsPublicationToCentralRepository` or similar phantom tasks:**
- This is a Gradle cache issue where removed repository configurations are still cached
- Solution: Run `./clean-gradle-cache.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `clean-gradle-cache.bat` (Windows)
- This completely clears Gradle's cache and removes all stale configurations
- After cleaning, only `GitHubPackagesRepository` tasks will be available

**Maven Central Publishing Notes:**
- Maven Central now uses the Central Portal (https://central.sonatype.com) for new accounts
- Traditional OSSRH publishing no longer works for accounts created in 2024+
- Use the provided `publish-to-central-portal.sh` script for Maven Central
- The script handles .klib file exclusion and automatic publishing
- GitHub Packages publishing works immediately without additional configuration

### Quick Testing

Run the included test scripts to verify everything works locally:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
run-tests.bat
```

These scripts will:
- âœ… Run all tests (JVM, JS with Chrome headless, and common)
- ðŸ”¨ Generate test reports in `build/reports/tests/`
- ðŸ“‹ Show test results summary

**Note:** JS tests may fail due to a known issue with Kotlin 2.2.0-Beta1 and kotlinx-serialization. This is a temporary issue that doesn't affect the main code compilation.

For a full build including packaging:
```bash
./gradlew build -x jsTest -x jsBrowserTest
```

## Installation

Summon is available from both Maven Central and GitHub Packages.

### From Maven Central (Recommended)

Add Summon to your project dependencies:

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation("io.github.codeyousef:summon:0.2.6")
            }
        }

        // Platform-specific dependencies (optional)
        val jvmMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation("io.github.codeyousef:summon-jvm:0.2.6")
            }
        }

        val jsMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation("io.github.codeyousef:summon-js:0.2.6")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### From GitHub Packages

If you prefer using GitHub Packages:

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven {
        url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/codeyousef/summon")
        credentials {
            username = project.findProperty("gpr.user") as String? ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_ACTOR")
            password = project.findProperty("gpr.key") as String? ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
        }
    }
}

// Dependencies same as above
```

**Note**: GitHub Packages requires authentication. Add your credentials to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```properties
gpr.user=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
gpr.key=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Generate a GitHub token with `read:packages` permission at https://github.com/settings/tokens
