# Summon

> ⚠️ **Alpha Status**: Summon is currently in alpha development and actively seeking testers and feedback. While core functionality is stable, APIs may change between releases. We welcome early adopters and contributors! Please report issues and share your experience.

**Summon** is a powerful, type-safe frontend framework for Kotlin Multiplatform that brings the elegance of Jetpack Compose to both browser and JVM environments. Build beautiful, responsive applications with a declarative syntax that feels natural to Kotlin developers.

## Project Structure

This monorepo contains:

- **`summon-core/`** - The main Summon library
- **`summon-cli/`** - Command-line tool for project generation 
- **`docs/`** - Documentation and guides

> 📝 **Examples**: Example projects showing various integrations have been moved to a separate repository for cleaner core library maintenance.

> 🎨 **Type-safe styling** with an intuitive modifier API inspired by Compose.
> 
> 🧩 **Component-based architecture** for maximum reusability and maintainability.
> 
> 🔄 **Reactive state management** that automatically updates your UI when data changes.

Summon combines the best ideas from modern frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Next.js with the declarative UI patterns of Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI, while leveraging Kotlin's powerful type system to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. Whether you're building a simple website or a complex web application, Summon provides the tools you need to create polished, professional user interfaces with less code and fewer bugs.

## Inspiration

Summon is proudly inspired by [Kobweb](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb), a modern framework for full stack web apps in Kotlin built upon Compose HTML. Kobweb's elegant API design and approach to creating web applications using Kotlin has been instrumental in shaping Summon's philosophy. We highly recommend checking out Kobweb if you're looking for a mature, feature-rich solution for Kotlin web development.

## Installation

Add Summon to your project dependencies from Maven Central:

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    // For JVM projects (Ktor, Spring Boot, Quarkus)
    implementation("io.github.codeyousef:summon-jvm:0.2.9.1")
    
    // For JavaScript/Browser projects
    implementation("io.github.codeyousef:summon-js:0.2.9.1")
    
    // For Kotlin Multiplatform projects
    implementation("io.github.codeyousef:summon:0.2.9.1")
}
```

**Note**: No authentication required - Summon is available directly from Maven Central!

## Version Management

Summon uses a centralized version management approach to ensure consistency across the main project and example projects. The version information is defined in a single place and referenced from all other places.

For more information, see [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).

## Security Best Practices

### Protecting Sensitive Credentials

To prevent accidentally committing sensitive credentials to the repository, Summon includes a Git pre-commit hook that checks for actual credentials in `gradle.properties`.

#### Installing the Git Hook

1. **Windows**:
   ```
   .git-hooks\install-hooks.bat
   ```

2. **Unix/Linux/macOS**:
   ```
   chmod +x .git-hooks/install-hooks.sh
   .git-hooks/install-hooks.sh
   ```

The pre-commit hook will prevent commits that contain actual credentials (not placeholders) in `gradle.properties`.

#### Recommended Approach for Credentials

For local development:

1. Keep placeholder values in `gradle.properties` (which is version controlled):
   ```properties
   # No authentication needed - using Maven Central
   ```

2. Store your actual credentials in `local.properties` (which is ignored by Git):
   ```properties
   # No authentication needed - using Maven Central
   ```

3. In your build script, prioritize values from `local.properties` over `gradle.properties`:
   ```kotlin
   val localProperties = java.util.Properties().apply {
       val localFile = rootProject.file("local.properties")
       if (localFile.exists()) {
           load(localFile.inputStream())
       }
   }

   // No authentication needed when using Maven Central
   // repositories { mavenCentral() }
   ```

This approach ensures that sensitive credentials are never committed to version control while maintaining a clear example of what credentials are needed in the version-controlled `gradle.properties` file.
