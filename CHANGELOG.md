## [0.2.4.5]

### Refactor
- **Compose Wrapper:** Introduce reusable `compose` wrapper for consistency
  - Refactored effects and hooks to leverage a generalized `compose` wrapper for consistent composition behavior
  - Simplified interval, timeout, and other effect implementations by reusing shared utility functions while ensuring clean-up and modularization
  - Standardized media query, localStorage, and event listener logic for improved testability and reduced redundancy

## [0.2.4.4]

### Fixed
- **Modifier Prefixing Logic:** Resolved inconsistencies in how internal prefixes (`__attr:`, `__event:`) were applied to HTML attributes and event handlers, which caused widespread test failures.
    - Reverted the `Modifier.style` member function (`Modifier.kt`) to its original behavior, ensuring it only handles standard CSS properties without adding any prefixes.
    - Updated helper extension functions (`AttributeModifiers.attribute` in `ModifierUtils.kt`, `CoreModifiers.event` in `CoreModifiers.kt`, and pointer event handlers like `onClick`, `onMouseEnter` in `PointerEventModifiers.kt`) to explicitly add the required prefixes (`__attr:` or `__event:`) to the style map keys.

### Changed
- **Component Attribute/Event Handling:** Ensured correct HTML attribute and event handler application in various components and utilities that rely on the fixed modifier helper functions. This includes, but is not limited to:
    - Accessibility utilities (`AccessibilityTree.kt`) relying on `__attr:` prefixes.
    - Components using `.attribute()` or event modifiers (e.g., `Badge.kt`, `DatePicker.kt`, `Select.kt`, `Text.kt`).
    - Note: Platform renderers (`JvmPlatformRenderer.kt`, `EnhancedJvmPlatformRenderer.kt`, `JsPlatformRenderer.kt`) and components calling them directly (`RangeSlider.kt`, `Slider.kt`, `Switch.kt`, `TimePicker.kt`) were not directly modified but benefit from the corrected modifier data they receive. `PlatformRenderer.kt` interface was unchanged.
