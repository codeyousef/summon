# Summon Migration Progress

## Completed Tasks
1. Fixed package declarations across the codebase to use fully qualified names:
   - `code.yousef.summon.modifier` for all modifier files
   - `code.yousef.summon.runtime` for runtime components

2. Created and fixed CompositionLocal implementation:
   - Implemented `CompositionLocalImpl` factory
   - Added support for both regular and static composition locals
   - Created provider interfaces and implementations

3. Updated Composer interface and implementations:
   - Aligned `Composer` interface methods across platforms
   - Created `JvmComposer` and `JsComposer` implementations
   - Added proper lifecycle management methods
   - Fixed method signatures to ensure consistent API

4. Updated components to use CompositionLocal:
   - `BasicText` - Now uses composer lifecycle
   - `Box` - Updated to use composer lifecycle
   - `AnimatedVisibility` - Fixed package and imports
   - Added `LocalDemoComponent` as an example for new component pattern

5. Created PointerEventModifiers:
   - Added event handlers for pointer events (click, touch, mouse, drag)
   - Implemented accessibility support
   - Reused existing `pointerEvents` from StylingModifiers

6. Implemented recomposition system:
   - Created `Recomposer` class for managing recompositions
   - Added `RecomposerHolder` to provide global access
   - Updated `CompositionLocal` to interact with the recomposer

7. Added convenient platform renderer access:
   - Created `getPlatformRenderer()` function
   - Updated components to use this simplified access method

8. Implemented state management system:
   - Added `State` and `MutableState` interfaces and implementations
   - Created `remember` function for composition-scoped state
   - Added `rememberMutableStateOf` for state management
   - Created `StatefulDemoComponent` as an example of state usage

## Next Steps
1. Complete implementation of remaining platform-specific renderers:
   - Update HTML and Android renderer implementations
   - Ensure all platform renderers support the new modifier system

2. Add tests for CompositionLocal system:
   - Test static and regular composition locals
   - Verify proper scoping and inheritance
   - Test the recomposition triggers

3. Implement lifecycle-aware effects:
   - Create `LaunchedEffect` for side effects
   - Add `DisposableEffect` for cleanup actions
   - Implement `SideEffect` for non-cancellable operations

4. Add documentation for migration best practices:
   - Update examples to show the new pattern
   - Document gotchas and edge cases
   - Create migration tutorial with step-by-step examples

5. Ensure all components are properly migrated:
   - Continue updating remaining components
   - Fix any package declaration issues
   - Update all imports to use fully qualified names
