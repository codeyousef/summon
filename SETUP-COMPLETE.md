# Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

You now have a fully configured Maven publishing and CI/CD pipeline for your Kotlin Multiplatform project. Here's what we've set up:

## What's Been Configured

### âœ… Build Configuration
- **Enhanced `build.gradle.kts`** with signing and publishing plugins
- **`publish.gradle.kts`** with comprehensive Maven publishing configuration
- **Chrome headless** setup for JavaScript tests in CI and locally
- **Gradle optimization** settings for better performance

### âœ… CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)
- **Automated testing** on all pull requests and pushes
- **Chrome headless** testing for JavaScript tests in CI
- **Snapshot publishing** to GitHub Packages on main branch pushes
- **Release publishing** to Maven Central when creating GitHub releases
- **Security scanning** with Trivy
- **Artifact caching** for faster builds

### âœ… Testing Scripts
- **`test-and-build.sh`** (Linux/macOS) - comprehensive testing script
- **`test-and-build.bat`** (Windows) - Windows equivalent testing script
- **Local Chrome detection** and headless configuration

### âœ… Documentation
- **`PUBLISHING.md`** - complete setup guide for Maven publishing
- **Updated `README.md`** - with publishing and CI/CD information
- **This summary file** - quick action checklist

## Next Steps (Action Required)

### 1. Update Repository Information
Edit `publish.gradle.kts` and replace placeholders:
```kotlin
// Replace these with your actual information:
url.set("https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/summon")
connection.set("scm:git:git://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/summon.git")
developerConnection.set("scm:git:ssh://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/summon.git")

developers {
    developer {
        id.set("YOUR_ID")
        name.set("Your Name")
        email.set("your.email@example.com")
    }
}
```

### 2. Set Up GitHub Secrets (Optional - for Maven Central)
If you want to publish to Maven Central, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
- `CENTRAL_USERNAME` - Your Central Portal username (from User Token page)
- `CENTRAL_PASSWORD` - Your Central Portal token (from User Token page)
- `SIGNING_KEY_ID` - Your GPG key ID
- `SIGNING_PASSWORD` - Your GPG key passphrase
- `SIGNING_SECRET_KEY` - Your GPG private key (base64 encoded)

**Note:** GitHub Packages publishing works automatically without additional secrets.

### 3. Test Locally
Run the test script to make sure everything works:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x test-and-build.sh
./test-and-build.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
test-and-build.bat
```

### 4. Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add Maven publishing and CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Monitor First CI Run
- Go to your GitHub repository â†’ Actions tab
- Watch your first CI/CD pipeline run
- All tests should pass and a snapshot should be published to GitHub Packages

### 6. Create Your First Release (When Ready)
1. Update version in `build.gradle.kts` (e.g., `version = "0.3.0"`)
2. Commit and push the version change
3. Go to GitHub â†’ Releases â†’ "Create a new release"
4. Create a tag (e.g., `v0.3.0`)
5. Write release notes
6. Click "Publish release"
7. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically publish to your configured Maven repository

## What Happens Automatically

### On Pull Requests:
- âœ… All tests run (JVM, JS with Chrome headless, common)
- âœ… Build verification
- âœ… Security scanning

### On Push to Main:
- âœ… All tests run
- âœ… Build completion
- âœ… **Snapshot published to GitHub Packages**

### On Release:
- âœ… All tests run
- âœ… Build completion
- âœ… **Release published to Maven Central** (if configured) or GitHub Packages

## Testing Your Setup

### Local Testing Commands:
```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run only JavaScript tests (requires Chrome)
./gradlew jsTest

# Run only JVM tests
./gradlew jvmTest

# Build everything
./gradlew build

# Test local publishing
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

### Check Published Packages:
- **GitHub Packages**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/summon/packages`
- **Maven Central**: `https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=code.yousef.summon` (after setup)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **JavaScript tests fail locally**:
   - Install Chrome or Chromium browser
   - Make sure it's available in your PATH

2. **Publishing fails**:
   - Check GitHub Secrets are correctly configured
   - Verify GPG key format (base64 encoded for secrets)
   - Ensure repository URLs are correct

3. **Build issues**:
   - Run `./gradlew clean` to clear caches
   - Delete `build/` directory
   - Check Gradle and Kotlin versions

### Getting Help:
- Check the [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md) for detailed setup instructions
- Review GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages
- Test locally first before debugging CI issues

## Success Metrics

You'll know everything is working when:
- âœ… Local test scripts pass
- âœ… GitHub Actions shows green checkmarks
- âœ… Packages appear in GitHub Packages after main branch push
- âœ… Release packages appear in your configured Maven repository after creating a release
