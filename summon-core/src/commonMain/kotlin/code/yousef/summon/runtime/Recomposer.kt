/**
 * Central coordinator for the Summon composition system that manages recomposition scheduling and execution.
 *
 * The Recomposer is the core orchestrator of Summon's reactive UI system. It tracks state dependencies,
 * schedules recomposition when state changes, and ensures efficient updates to the UI tree. The Recomposer
 * works in concert with [Composer] instances to provide a declarative, reactive user interface.
 *
 * ## Core Responsibilities
 *
 * ### State Dependency Tracking
 * - Maintains mapping between state objects and dependent [Composer] instances
 * - Records when composable functions read from state objects
 * - Automatically invalidates affected composables when state changes
 *
 * ### Recomposition Scheduling
 * - Batches recomposition requests for optimal performance
 * - Uses platform-specific schedulers for appropriate timing
 * - Prevents duplicate recomposition of the same composer
 * - Integrates with platform UI update cycles
 *
 * ### Composer Lifecycle Management
 * - Creates and manages [Composer] instances
 * - Tracks active composer during composition
 * - Handles cleanup when composers are disposed
 *
 * ## Recomposition Process
 *
 * The recomposition workflow follows these steps:
 *
 * 1. **Dependency Tracking**: During initial composition, the Recomposer records which
 *    state objects are read by each composable function
 * 2. **Change Detection**: When state objects are modified, [recordStateWrite] is called
 * 3. **Scheduling**: Affected composers are added to the pending recomposition queue
 * 4. **Batch Processing**: [processRecompositions] executes all pending recompositions
 * 5. **Efficient Updates**: Only composables that depend on changed state are re-executed
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 *
 * The Recomposer provides thread-safe operations through platform-specific implementations:
 * - State change notifications can come from any thread
 * - Recomposition scheduling is thread-safe
 * - Actual composition execution happens on the appropriate UI thread
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Create and configure a recomposer
 * val recomposer = Recomposer()
 * recomposer.setCompositionRoot {
 *     MyApplication()
 * }
 *
 * // State changes automatically trigger recomposition
 * var counter by mutableStateOf(0)
 *
 * @Composable
 * fun MyApplication() {
 *     Button(
 *         onClick = { counter++ },  // This triggers recomposition
 *         label = "Count: $counter"
 *     )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Integration with Framework Components
 *
 * - **Composer**: Creates and manages composer instances for composition tracking
 * - **State Objects**: Automatically tracks reads/writes through [mutableStateOf] and similar APIs
 * - **Platform Renderer**: Coordinates with rendering system for UI updates
 * - **Effect System**: Manages effect lifecycle during recomposition
 * - **Scheduler**: Uses platform-specific scheduling for optimal performance
 *
 * ## Performance Characteristics
 *
 * - **Batched Updates**: Multiple state changes are batched into single recomposition passes
 * - **Minimal Recomposition**: Only affected composables are re-executed
 * - **Dependency Pruning**: Unused dependencies are automatically cleaned up
 * - **Memory Efficient**: Uses weak references and cleanup strategies to prevent memory leaks

     *
     * ## Automatic Recomposition
     *
