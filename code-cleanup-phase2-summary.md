# Code Cleanup Phase 2 Summary

## Overview
This phase focused on removing additional code duplications found throughout the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Consolidated Breakpoints Objects
- Updated `MediaEffects.kt` to reference `MediaQuery.Breakpoints` values
- Added helper functions to convert between breakpoint values and media query strings
- Maintained backward compatibility with val properties instead of const

### 2. Fixed SelectOption Duplication
- Removed duplicate `SelectOption` data class from `Select.kt`
- Updated all references to use the single definition from `PlatformRenderer.kt`
- Updated test imports to use `runtime.SelectOption`

### 3. Removed Duplicate Type Alias
- Deleted `/theme/util/TextStyle.kt` as it was a duplicate of `/theme/TextStyle.kt`
- The one in `/theme/` is actively used by imports

### 4. Removed Deprecated Files
- Deleted the deprecated `routing/seo/DeepLinking.kt` file
- All functionality is now in the main `routing/DeepLinking.kt`

### 5. Created SerializationUtils
- Created `SerializationUtils.kt` to consolidate JSON serialization functions
- Functions consolidated:
  - `serializeInitialState()`
  - `serializeValue()`
  - `escapeJsonString()`
- Updated `DynamicRendering.kt` to use the centralized implementation

## Remaining Work
1. Update remaining SSR files to use SerializationUtils
2. Unify History Management implementations  
3. Consider renaming Alignment/Arrangement enums for clarity

## Impact
- Reduced code duplication across the codebase
- Improved maintainability through centralized implementations
- Maintained backward compatibility where possible
- Cleaner, more consistent codebase structure
